# Setup your AWS Platform (AWS) Account

### Why do this
 - Your workload is too big to run on your laptop.
 - You don't want to wait for compute time on your organization's shared, on-premise compute cluster.
 - You want to use AWS Platform services to run large (or huge) genomic analysis jobs.

### What is this
 - The ability to perform analysis (or compute) on files (and other types of data) at dynamic scale 
 - Preparation for running analysis on public cloud services hosted by AWS

### Key considerations
 - Use the best fit AWS Account type:  
    - **Use AWS Free Tier** - get $ 300 USD in AWS credits for new users. Use AWS with minimal-sized service limits set by Google (i.e max number of CPUs for VMs...) - [link to free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). 

    --OR--  

    - **Use Your Organization's AWS Account** - service limits set by your company & Google
 - Understand your project scope:
    - the size & complexity of your analysis  
    - your project budget / timeline  
 - Determine the best location (AWS data center):
    - AWS cloud has regional data centers which are further divded into zones within the physical data center location
    - global [AWS data center locations](https://Amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions-and-availability/)

 NOTE: There are many bioinformatics analysis workflow tools, libraries & solutions which can be run on top of core AWS services.  Examples include [cromwell](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [Nextflow.io](https://www.nextflow.io/) & many others.
