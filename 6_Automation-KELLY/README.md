# Use AWS Services for Code & Monitoring

In this section, you'll get information about using AWS tools for code & configuration monitoring.  You'll use AWS Deployments for service configuration management.  

Also you'll use AWS Elastic Container Registry to host docker container images.  Additionally you'll use AWS CloudWatch to interpret service logs for monitoring.

### Here are the topic pages in this section:

- Use Code Commit Repositories for code 
- Use Deployment manager to deploy infrastructure
- Use Container Registry to host container images
- Monitor services with CloudWatch for reading logs
