# Use Nextflow for Genomic Data Analysis

### Why do this
 USE the Nextflow pipeline language to define and run your genomic data analysis workflows (also called pipelines or jobs) at scale on the cloud or on-prem environment of your choosing.

### What is this
Nextflow is a reactive bioinformatics workflow framework & DSL for writing data-intensive computational pipelines.  Run jobs as scripts or containers on a single AWS EC2 Virtual Machine or a cluster of VMs. You can use AWS Batch to orchestrate your Nextflow jobs.
 - Understand core Nextflow features - [link](https://www.nextflow.io/index.html#Features)
 - Nextflow can run on AWS or many other providers (i.e. Azure, GCP, HPC, etc...)
 - Nextflow can run jobs on AWS in several ways...
   - On a single EC2 VMs (can run bioinformatics tools from Docker)
   - On mulitple EC2 VMS using the **& AWS Batch** API
   - On ECS clusters with mulitple Docker container images (runs on EC2 VMS) using the **& AWS Batch** API
   - Via the Nextflow Seqera Platform using ECS clusters using the **& AWS Batch** API - see this [page](https://github.com/lynnlangit/aws-for-bioinformatics/blob/main/3_VMs_%26_Batch-LYNN/3a_Use_Seqera_for_Nextflow.md)

Shown below is a reference architecture for running Nextflow analysis on AWS using the AWS Batch API.

### How to do this
 - SETUP prereqs for Nextflow on your VM - JDK, Docker, Graphviz(optional)
 - RUN VariantCalling pipeline w/GATK - [link](https://github.com/CRG-CNAG/CalliNGS-NF/)

### How to verify you've done it
 - VERIFY using a short example script - [link](https://gist.github.com/lynnlangit/c1ed2a3535b3ae6711dd14687d5174c3)
 - VERIFY the output files from the examples above
 - REVIEW Nextflow examples which produce files in a `results` folder

### Other Nextflow Tools 
The Nextflow ecosystem includes a growing set of tools for scripting, registering, monitoring and tracing pipelines in addition to Seqera for running and monitoring pipeline jobs.
 - üìò Use [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) for locating reusable Nextflow pipelines
 - üìò Use [Wave containers](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/wave.html) for provisioning containers (with bioinformatics tools) for Nextflow pipelines
 - üìò Use [nf-core tools](https://nf-co.re/tools) for configuring, running, monitoring and managing reusable Nextflow pipelines
 - üìò Use [Nextflow cli](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/edge/cli.html) for scripting 
 - üìò Use [Nextflow tracing & viz tools](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) for monitoring pipeline runs
