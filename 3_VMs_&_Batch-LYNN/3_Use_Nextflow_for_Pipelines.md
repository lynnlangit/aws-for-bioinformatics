# Use Nextflow for Genomic Data Analysis

### Why do this
 USE the Nextflow pipeline language to define and run your genomic data analysis workflows (also called pipelines or jobs) at scale on the cloud or on-prem environment of your choosing.

### What is this
Nextflow is a reactive bioinformatics workflow framework & DSL for writing data-intensive computational pipelines.  Run jobs as scripts or containers on a single AWS EC2 Virtual Machine or a cluster of VMs. You can use AWS Batch to orchestrate your Nextflow jobs.
 - Understand core Nextflow features - [link](https://www.nextflow.io/index.html#Features)
 - Nextflow can run on AWS or many other providers (i.e. Azure, GCP, HPC, etc...)
 - Nextflow can run jobs on AWS in several ways...
   - On a single EC2 VMs (can run bioinformatics tools from Docker)
   - On mulitple EC2 VMS using the **& AWS Batch** API
   - On ECS clusters with mulitple Docker container images (runs on EC2 VMS) using the **& AWS Batch** API
   - Via the Nextflow Seqera Platform using ECS clusters using the **& AWS Batch** API - see this [page](https://github.com/lynnlangit/aws-for-bioinformatics/blob/main/3_VMs_%26_Batch-LYNN/3a_Use_Seqera_for_Nextflow.md)

Shown below is a reference architecture for running Nextflow analysis on AWS using the AWS Batch API.

### How to do this
 - SETUP prereqs for Nextflow on your VM - JDK, Docker, Graphviz(optional)
 - RUN VariantCalling pipeline w/GATK - [link](https://github.com/CRG-CNAG/CalliNGS-NF/)

### How to verify you've done it
 - VERIFY using a short example script - [link](https://gist.github.com/lynnlangit/c1ed2a3535b3ae6711dd14687d5174c3)
 - VERIFY the output files from the examples above
 - REVIEW Nextflow examples which produce files in a `results` folder

### Other Things to Know
 - RUN short example using Nextflow and the `blastn` tool, running in Docker on a custom GCE VM image - [link](https://medium.com/@lynnlangit/cloud-native-hello-world-for-bioinformatics-7831aecc8d1a)
 - FIND and run example Nextflow bioinformatics pipelines (such as one for 'rnaseq jobs') at the `nf-core` site - [link](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/docs)
 - MONITOR running Nextflow pipelines using the visual `Nextflow Tower` tool - [link](https://tower.nf/)
 - REGISTER Nextflow workflows for distribution and reuse in the [Dockstore](https://docs.dockstore.org/docs/prereqs/getting-started-with-nextflow/) genomics workflow registry
    - Note that Nextflow (NF) on Dockstore is a bit different from CWL or WDL. 
    - Instead of having one workflow descriptor file, Nextflow with Dockstore uses two different kinds of files: A config file, `nextflow.config` and a descriptor file, generally called, `main.nf`.

### Other Nextflow Tools 
The Nextflow ecosystem includes a growing set of tools for scripting, registering, monitoring and tracing pipelines in addition to Seqera for running and monitoring pipeline jobs.
