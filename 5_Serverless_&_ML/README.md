# Use Serverless and Machine Learning AWS Services

In this section, you'll get information about using AWS services to run serverless service to run data pipeline (workflow) genomic analysis jobs on AWS.  

In this section, you'll get information about using AWS services for serverless compute and also for machine learning-type processes.  There are a serveral methods for letting AWS manage the underlying servers (and containers), so that you can simply write and upload method (or function code) and let AWS handle the scaling.    

### Here are the topic pages in this section:

- Use Lambda, Athena or other AWS services for serverless compute
- Use Sagemaker and Jupyter Notebooks or SageMaker APIs
- Use Machine Learning APIs
