# Advanced AWS Lambda

****CONTINUE HERE****

### Why do this
 - RUN stateless, short-term compute tasks
 - RUN your analysis job tasks individually, or chained into a workflow (or pipeline)
 - PAY only **when a Lambda is called (or invoked)**, rather than for a long-running VM or container

### What is this
 - Use functions where you supply your own containers, rather than AWS-supplied containers or VMs for compute
 - Use advanced configuration of Lambda instances (memory, timeout, etc...)

### Key considerations
 - In Cloud Run, you supply the code and container file (Dockerfile), AWS builds, registers and runs your container image. Your Lambda can be called via HTTP requests
 - State is NOT automatically saved after the Lambdais invoked.  If you need to persist information, then you must write the logic to save the output to files (bucket) or a database and then to retrieve that information in a later part of the workflow

### How to do this
 - WRITE and test your Lambda code
 - BUILD a docker image w/that code by running 'docker build....' on a DOCKERFILE
 - REGISTER your docker container image in the Elastic Container Registry
 - ASSOCIATE your image to Lambda by running 'aws lambda create-function' 
 - TEST (invoke) and monitor your service

### How to verify you've done it
 - INVOKE the Lambda manually or via a test script
 - REVIEW the CloudWatch logs to see the result of the Lambdainvocation

### Other Things to Know
 - Serverless patterns are often used for workloads that have spikes in demand
 - Using the 'revision settings' you can set a min/max number of instances for autoscaling for your deployment.  You can also set the 'maximum requests per container'
 - Serverless auto-scales (to your AWS account limits) by default
 - A number of services can be run 'serverlessly' - this includes EMR (Managed Apache Spark).  Here's an example from CSIRO (EMR Serverless Terraform template) -[link](https://bioinformatics.csiro.au/blog/the-many-ways-to-the-cloud-from-on-prem-to-emr-serverless/)
