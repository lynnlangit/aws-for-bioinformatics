# Use AWS Services for Machine Learning

In this section, you'll get information about using AWS services for machine learning.  Also you'll use AWS ML APIs and services.  Additionally you'll use AWS SageMaker Lab to run jobs in a Jupyter notebook.  Useful presentation on notebook options for AWS - https://mco.dev/so-many-notebooks-so-little-time.../

Many services available:
- SageMaker & SageMaker Studio - more on this - [link](https://github.com/lynnlangit/Hello-AWS-Data-Services/tree/master/5_machine-learning/1_SageMaker)
- Awesome SageMaker Repo - https://github.com/aws-samples/awesome-sagemaker
- AWS Deep Learning AMI - https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/amis/

Here are the topic pages in this section:

***TO DO***
 - SageMaker Studio Lab vs. SageMaker for Managed Jupyter Notebooks
 - SageMaker tools for model lifecycle (create, tune, deploy) - include hyperparameter grids
 - AWS DeepLearning VM (note ML libraries and hardware drivers installed [for GPUs])
 - AWS ML APIs - vision, video, speed, text, medical?
 - Marketplace - Parabricks 

NOTE: Right click on the 'Open in SageMaker Studio Lab' button at the top of the *.ipynb (IPython notebook file) and 'open link in a new tab' as directly opening this link is blocked in GitHub.

### For More Information

I created an entire course on LinkedIn Learning on AWS Machine Learning.  Also I published a GitHub Repo with code samples for AWS Machine Learning services - [link](https://github.com/lynnlangit/AWS-ml) for more advanced machine learning scenarios.
