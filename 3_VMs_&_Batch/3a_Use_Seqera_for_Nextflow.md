# Use Seqera for Nextflow for Genomic Data Analysis

### Why do this & What is this
- USE the [Seqera tools for the Nextflow pipeline language](https://cloud.seqera.io/) to define and run your genomic data analysis workflows (also called pipelines or jobs) at scale on the cloud or on-prem environment of your choosing with minimal manual configuration and rich job run information visualizations. NOTE: Seqera tools was previously named 'NF-Tower' or 'Tower Forge'.
- USE **Nextflow tools** with Nextflow for ease of use with AWS Batch.  You can use AWS Batch to orchestrate your Nextflow jobs.

### How to do (and verify) this
 - TEST one or more example (community) Nextflow pipelines by creating job runs on the Seqera Platform - [link](https://cloud.seqera.io/) using either [Tower Forge or Manual](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/23.4.0/compute-envs/aws-batch)
 - CONFIGURE credentials for your own runtime environment (AWS, GCP...)
 - CONFIGURE pipeline params to use your own sample (input) data
 - REVIEW job run output in the Seqera Platform.  Examples screens shown below.

### Other Nextflow Tools 
The Nextflow ecosystem includes a growing set of tools for scripting, registering, monitoring and tracing pipelines in addition to Seqera for running and monitoring pipeline jobs.
 - üìò Use [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) for locating reusable Nextflow pipelines
 - üìò Use [Wave containers](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/wave.html) for provisioning containers (with bioinformatics tools) for Nextflow pipelines
 - üìò Use [nf-core tools](https://nf-co.re/tools) for configuring, running, monitoring and managing reusable Nextflow pipelines
 - üìò Use [Nextflow cli](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/edge/cli.html) for scripting 
 - üìò Use [Nextflow tracing & viz tools](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) for monitoring pipeline runs
