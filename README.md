<kbd><img src="https://github.com/lynnlangit/aws-for-bioinformatics/blob/main/7_REF_Info/images/aws-genomics.png" width=900></kbd>

You can use AWS to address key bioinformatics use cases (categories shown above / image from AWS documentation).  AWS includes tools and services which enable genomic researchers to ingest, process and analyze their genomic datasets using the elastic scale of the AWS cloud. 

## What's Here?

This repo hosts a **free and open source** course **"AWS for Bioinformatics"**.  Course Materials include this repo and a YouTube playlist. 
- ðŸ“º **aws-for-bioinformatics** playlist on YouTube - [link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4Q4HssKcxYt48KtjpILjwTT-6s-zziDj). 
  - On the playlist are linked short 'AWS in action' screencasts --AND--
  - Also linked recordings of Lynn's public talks on building and deploying genomic solutions on AWS.
- NOTE: This course is a WIP, I'll be adding more resources frequently. Please `watch` this Repo to get updates when we add material.

This course covers a core AWS services used in a set of generic genomics reference architectures. We group these services by category (i.e. compute, storage, security, etc...) and explain in each section how and why to use these AWS services. Bioinformatics data, tools and libraries are used in examples.
  - for detail about the scenarios see the `Reference` section - [link](https://github.com/lynnlangit/aws-for-bioinformatics/tree/main/7_REF_Info)
